# Arduino-Powered-Metronome
I've built a digital metronome, using an Arduino Uno Board, buzzer, a display showing BPM(beats per minute) and a whole lotta wires. 
It is still currently "under construction", since I plan to add two pushbuttons to manually increment/decrement the BPM speed, add an on/off switch and 
build a casing when it's done. 

Will post the wiring schematic and components when done.
So far, it works perfectly. Since there's no pushbuttons or dedicated pot to change the BPM yet, you may change it using the Arduino IDE,
by modifying the tempo variable.
